# bookings-calendar-sync

Holiday rentals calendar sync for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) booking systems.

This project will start soon, hopefully. But I need first to convert my existing data from HotelDruid, so my focus is on [hoteldruid-migration](https://github.com/magicoli/hoteldruid-migration) project, and then I will work on this one.

Its intend is to provide real time calendar sync for a local reservation plugin with an OTA

## WordPress booking system

- [WooCommerce Bookings](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-bookings/)
- maybe in the future: [Maestrel HBook](https://maestrel.com/hbook/), [MotoPress Hotel Booking](https://motopress.com/products/hotel-booking/)

## External OTA

- [Lodgify](https://Lodgify1.referralrock.com/l/1OLIVIERVAN88/)
